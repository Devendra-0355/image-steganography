Image Steganography (Python)

How to explain:

“This project is a Python-based image steganography tool. It hides secret text messages inside an image by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values, so the visual quality of the image remains unchanged. The same program can also extract the hidden message back from the image.”

Key points to mention:

->Uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique

->No visible change to the image

->Encoding and decoding supported

If asked why you chose it:

“I wanted to work on a security-oriented project and understand how data can be hidden securely inside media.”
